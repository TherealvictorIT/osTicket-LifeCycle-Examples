<h1>osTicket - LifeCycle Examples Setup</h1>
</p>
This tutorial covers the process of creating tickets in osTicket as an end user. For example, if Ken is experiencing an issue with mobile banking, he can create a ticket and select the appropriate help topic, such as "Business Critical Outage," to indicate the urgency and importance of the request. This will help ensure that the ticket is prioritized appropriately and that agents are able to respond quickly and effectively to resolve the issue. 
</p>
By following this tutorial, end users can gain a better understanding of how to create tickets in osTicket and improve the overall efficiency and effectiveness of their interactions with the help desk.

Agents will be able to see live tickets in the agent panel. Queue managers will assign priority tickets to the appropriate agents as well as assigning proper SLAs.

In this example we are setting the priority level of the ticket. The priority has been set to Emergency since we are dealing with an issue that can effect an entire portion of the business. We have changed the SLA plan and assigned the ticket to a top level technician. In some ticketing system customers can set their own SLA plans.
