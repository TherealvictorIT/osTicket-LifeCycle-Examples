In this example Ken is experiencing an issue with mobile banking, he can create a ticket and select the appropriate help topic, such as "Business Critical Outage," to indicate the urgency and importance of the request. This will help ensure that the ticket is prioritized appropriately and that agents are able to respond quickly and effectively to resolve the issue.

In the agent panel, agents will be able to view live tickets as they are submitted by end users. These tickets may be assigned different priorities by queue managers, who are responsible for ensuring that priority tickets are assigned to the appropriate agents and that SLAs are applied as needed.

We are also able to set the priority level of a ticket in osTicket. We have selected the "Emergency" priority level, as the issue at hand could potentially impact an entire portion of the business. Additionally, we have changed the SLA plan and assigned the ticket to a top-level technician, to ensure that it is addressed quickly and effectively. Depending on your ticketing system, end users may be able to set their own SLA plans, which can help ensure that their requests are prioritized appropriately and resolved in a timely manner. By leveraging the right priority levels and SLA plans, help desk teams can optimize their workflows and deliver better outcomes for their customers.
